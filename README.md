AWS-Lambda Functions using the Serverless Framework and Braintree Payments
==========================================================================

Using Node.js and Braintree payment, I created some lambda functions for proccessing transactions, storing payment methods and deleting payment methods.

Lambda functions can be used in a Serverless architecture with AWS-API-Gateway to invoke a REST API 'like' service

Things you'll need...
1. npm braintree
2. npm serverless

In the yaml file you will find all AWS-API-Gateway functions that you can access through your client application via an endpoint given by AWS
